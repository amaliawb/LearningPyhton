- parameter = var in defining function
- mudule = a file that contains definitions—including variables and functions—that you can use once it is imported.


- argument = var input to a function
-to check if there is input
if len(variable) > 0:
    do somthing with it
else:
    print empthy or return 1?

- method.isalpha() checks if the string is only chars

- seder peulot - 1111 not 2222 and 3333 or 444 is not/not in
